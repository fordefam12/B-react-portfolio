        Greetings! I'm a former X-ray technician who has found a new passion in software development. Hailing from Houston, TX, my journey has been anything but ordinary. With a background in the military as a welder, I've honed my skills in precision and attention to detail. Transitioning to the world of coding, I've discovered a thrilling avenue for creativity and problem-solving. My diverse experiences have equipped me with a unique perspective, allowing me to approach development with a blend of discipline, adaptability, and a keen eye for innovation. I'm excited to continually learn, grow, and contribute to the dynamic landscape of technology.
